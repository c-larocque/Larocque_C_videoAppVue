(4, NULL, '“Extremely powerful and exciting war movie about the evacuation during WW2. Driven by a non-chronological narrative in three point of views, the breathless editing and a nerve-wracking score the film delivers several nail-biting sequences and a very powerful and emotional ending. The cast mostly relies on no names and very few stars, all bringing very convincing performances to the table. Additionally, the film is beautifully shot. Another masterpiece by Nolan and a highlight of the genre.” - Jens S.', '2018-04-01 14:55:29', 2, 4),

British, Belgian and French troops were cut off within Dunkirk, surrounded by advancing German troops. The allies were literally fish in a barrel to the German forces. They were stranded, being attacked from both land and air with the sea to their backs, nowhere to run. Situated in Northern France, Dunkirk was the location of the massive evac operation which saw large numbers of British civilians man their own vessels in order to assist with the rescue.” - Phil Hubbs', '2018-04-01 14:56:55', 2, 5),
(6, NULL, '“It\'s now fair to say that Christopher Nolan has become a director that instils huge anticipation when he announces a new film project. He\'s equally adept at providing low-key, personal, thrillers like Memento and Insomnia and more than proved his worth with big-budget spectacles like The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and Interstellar. It\'s fitting then that he tackle a war drama - a genre that demands an element of both approaches.” - Mark Walker', '2018-04-01 14:57:35', 2, 3),

The tenth installment in the X-Men franchise, the third solo Wolverine movie and the first R rated movie. Taking much inspiration from the classic comicbook series \'Old Man Logan\' the movie is technically a stand alone story clear of any previous events in early movies. But this seems to be unclear with some saying it is a sequel to \'Apocalypse\' but not a direct sequel.

James Mangold\'s brutal second foray in the standalone adventures of the X-Men\'s most popular mutant is a bold, savage vision with maturity and grit not seen in a superhero film before (or most modern blockbusters for that matter). \"Logan\'s\" influences don\'t go wholly unnoticed, but it remains very much it\'s own beast.” - Michael S.', '2018-04-01 15:51:58', 3, 5),

This is one of the most original films you will see all year, by far, but I\'ll say that there is no chance of every viewer enjoying it from start to finish. The mere premise itself is enough to turn people off, but if you can leave certain beliefs at the door when watching Okja, you may just find yourself enjoying it as much as I did.

At times in the beginning, the films seemed shot-for-shot duplicates. In that light, the live-action music, characters and singing just aren\'t as \"big\" as those in the animated film. However, making such a comparison, is not fair to this live-action version, which itself is very fine. The sets and costumes are spectacular.

(17, NULL, '“Somewhat torn about this. The directing, look and acting is top-notch, no doubt about it. Especially the huge battle scenes are impressive, disgusting and engaging, almost rivaling Saving Private Ryan\'s. The beginning does take its time introducing our protagonist and his early life. His ultimate engagement is unbelievable and the definition of a hero. While you feel some parts may be a bit exaggerated, the actual quotes the movie ends with prove many details right. On the other side, the film is neither particularly subtle about Doss\' belief nor in making monsters out of the enemy.” - Jens S.', '2018-04-09 20:35:23', 6, 3),

Amy Adams is yet again excellent as one linquist tasked with deciphering their burps and giggles, with a twist ending on the horizon. Thought provoking yet slow as molasses.” - Kevin M. Williams', '2018-04-19 15:02:47', 8, 3),
(24, NULL, '“With his debut Incendies in 2010, Denis Villeneuve really hit the ground running and has been one of the most consistently interesting director\'s for the last 7 years. There\'s a host of films and genres that Villeneuve has explored in that time; from the nightmarish surrealism of Enemy; his unflinching kidnap thriller Prisoners and his drug cartel action drama Sicario.” - Mark Walker', '2018-04-19 15:07:42', 8, 4),
(25, NULL, '“Though it aims for heroism, Edwards\' story doesn\'t have a dramatic enough arc to be truly inspirational. It\'s not about winning, it\'s an ode to participation, which isn\'t enough for it to get off the ground.” - Adam Graham', '2018-04-19 15:07:47', 9, 2),
(26, NULL, '“The kind of inspirational story in which we know everything that is going to happen but still we happily embrace the clichés that make it seem like a delicious throwback to the \'80s (the music is great), and Egerton has so much charisma that we can\'t help but fall in love with his character.” - Carlos Magalhães', '2018-04-19 19:01:44', 9, 4),
(27, NULL, '“Eddie the Eagle all works together in a rather campy, but loving tribute. My lack of familiarity with the actual man is a benefit because Edgerton\'s performance never rang false. It\'s an odd characterization. Taron Edgerton dons big glasses and affects an underbite to play the gawky athlete. He mercilessly hams it up playing up Eddie\'s little eccentricities. Occasionally the portrait verges on caricature. However Eddie is so likable and sweet that you forgive the affectations.

(28, NULL, '“You know, it\'s been a while since Pixar made a real masterpiece. Inside Out and Finding Dory were both great, great movies, but there\'s no denying that, at least to me, it fell short of Pixar\'s best flicks. Don\'t even get me started on The Good Dinosaur, a B-team Pixar effort. The last true masterpiece we got from a North American animated movie, to me, was The Lego Movie and it\'s been three years. And I make the distinction, because there\'s many great animated films from all over the world that I haven\'t seen yet.” - Jesse Ortega', '2018-04-19 19:24:24', 10, 2),
(29, NULL, '“It\'s difficult to not feel indifferent about a movie like Trolls. In the end, it\'s fine. Is it somewhat offensive in terms of originality and cheap covers of gloriously good pop songs? It could certainly be taken that way, but when taking into consideration the target audience for this latest DreamWorks animated adventure it\'s hard to get too frustrated with the rote story Trolls tolls out or the advantage it takes in remixing recognizable songs into auto-tuned Kidz Bop versions you could have certainly lived without. Of course, Trolls doesn\'t mean to offend, but rather it simply means to entertain a fairly wide age range of kiddos while at the same time giving over tried and true lessons that deal in being true to one\'s self to find true happiness. No, Trolls isn\'t either a good film or a particularly bad one, but more it is simply one that exists to colorfully distract for an hour and a half only to mostly be forgotten the next day. No harm, no foul.” - Philip Price', '2018-04-19 19:44:05', 10, 3),
(30, NULL, '“Trolls is a neon-tinted explosion of glitter, music and fast-paced humor. It may not be an animated masterpiece but there are some very creative and charming things happening in this film. DreamWorks isn\'t at the level of challenging Disney or Pixar and they prove it again with their latest, but if Trolls maybe isn\'t ambitious it\'s a lot of fun. The animation is lovely to look at. Colorful and tactile with use of felt and scrapbook cutouts, the animation sparkles. The film tells an important if rather basic message about happiness and how it is found within.” - Bradley J.', '2018-04-20 13:41:27', 10, 3),
(31, NULL, '“DiCaprio is called on to depict the man\'s desperation, grief and searing anger almost entirely through his eyes and he does it with remarkable depth, turning Glass\'s endurance into a steadfastness both physical and emotional.” - Kate Taylor', '2018-04-20 14:16:40', 11, 4),
(32, NULL, '“The enormously talented Alejandro G. Iñárritu (\"Amores Perros,\" \"21 Grams,\" \"Birdman\") strikes again with this 19th century American fable, one of the most brutally beautiful movies I\'ve ever seen.” - Richard Roeper', '2018-04-20 14:20:35', 11, 5),
(33, NULL, '“Knowing this is an Inarritu film, I assumed the Directing and Cinematography would carry a lackluster story to make for a decent film. The story, however, very much held its own with the outstanding Directing and Camerawork, not to mention the great performances by DiCaprio and Hardy. This movie turned out to be a great and very well rounded thriller.” - Sanjay Rema', '2018-04-20 14:31:33', 11, 4),
(34, NULL, '“It\'s this fact that makes Brooklyn so relevant. As our country debates whether to allow refugees in, we need to reflect upon our own histories and recognize so many common dreams and goals. We\'re all Eilis.” - Alexandra MacAaron', '2018-04-20 14:52:19', 12, 5);
